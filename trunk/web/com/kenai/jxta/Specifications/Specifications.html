<h2>Goal &amp; Activities</h2>
This Kenai project is responsible for the formal specification and
documention of the JXTA Protocols. Compliant JXTA implementations must
conform the schemas, specifications and behaviours that the
specification describes.<br />
The JXTA Protocol Specification Project is focused upon the following
tasks: <br />
i) Developing formal, normative schemas for all of the XML structures
used by the JXTA Protocol.<br />
ii) Developing formal specifications and descriptions of the behaviour
of
the JXTA Protocols as well as the overall architecture of JXTA.<br />
iii) Work with the JXTA user and implemntor communities as well as the
IETF/IRTF and other specification communities on the development and
specification of the JXTA protocols.
<h2><a name="Structure"></a>Status</h2>
The JXTA Specification was submitted to the IETF June of 2002 in
anticipation of participating with a working group. The IETF declined
assign JXTA to a working group, but instead referred JXTA to their
sister organization IRTF. The JXTA project participates with the IRTF's
Peer-to-Peer working group, but we have also independently continued to
advance the JXTA specification.<br />
The JXTA Project continues to enhance, evolve and extend the JXTA Protocol
Specification. We remain interested in working with standards bodies on
formal approval, but for the current time our focus is working with the
JXTA user and implementor communities to extend JXTA to meet their
needs.
