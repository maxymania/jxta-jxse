Configuration
=============

All of the tutorials programs are pre-configured to use AD-HOC networking. You can run all of these tutorials on a local sub-net without needing to do any additional configuration. However, as configured, the peers will not easily communicate with peers across the Internet or through firewalls or NAT. 

** IMPORTANT ** 

In order to use these examples with peers which are on different subnets it will be necessary to change the peer configurations!
