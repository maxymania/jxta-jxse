<h2><a name="Governance_Guidelines"></a>Governance
Guidelines</h2>
We believe that a governance
system that is clearly outlined and fairly represents the
community is essential to the development of JXTA technology.
<p>JXTA technology is about providing a common framework, on top
of which innovative distributed computing applications can be
developed. This common framework will need to mature and become
stable-staying small, but supporting essential qualities required by a
majority of developers. A strong governance system will provide a means
to manage the process of its evolution. Initially we will build on the
model used by other open source projects, a meritocracy based on
consensus.</p>
<p>All decision making, planning and communication will be done
in the open, on public mailing lists.</p>
<h2><a name="The_Board"></a>The Board<strong></strong><br />
</h2>
The Board consists of three members, including one representative
selected by Sun and two independent, non-Sun representatives who are
nominated and elected by the community.&nbsp;Notice is given of the
next election on the <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>
and on the corresponding Kenai project mailing lists.
<p>The Board has high-level duties to ensure that the JXTA
Technology project is being run in a fair and open manner. The Board
exists as a last resort to resolve disputes and grievances. Every
effort should be made to solve disputes at the community level before
turning to the Board.</p>
<p>We are attempting to make the governance procedures as
lightweight as possible. We seek above all to invite all interested
developers to take part in the enhancement of this project and seek
input from all. We are attempting to make sure the governance
procedures will not hinder the momentum of any group or individual who
seeks to use JXTA technology.</p>
<p>This governance system might change as the Project JXTA
community grows, but we are committed to a system that is fair and open
to all community members. If you have any questions, suggestions,
and/or concerns, please post them on the general mailing list.</p>
<p>* The term for the JXTA Board of Directors was changed from 1
year to 2 years per community vote February 2006.<br />
* Board of Director meeting notes are available.</p>
<h2><a name="Board_Rules"></a>Board<strong></strong>
Rules<br />
</h2>
<strong>Composition</strong>
<p>The JXTA board of directors consists of three (3) standing
members. One (1) seat is reserved for a Sun Microsystems employee
appointed by Sun management. The other two seats are filled by
community members voted in by the community and certified by the JXTA
community manager or other appointed JXTA community member charged with
conducting the election. No board members may be appointed any
responsibilities for conducting any JXTA election while he or she is
serving on the JXTA board.</p>
<p><strong> JXTA Board Mission</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the JXTA Board of Directors is to:</p>
<p> * ensure the successful growth of the JXTA community<br />
* promote the JXTA Protocols as a standard for peer to peer network<br />
application development<br />
* support JXTA projects used to host development and distribution of:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; o the platform-independent JXTA protocol
specifications<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; o JXTA-related documentation<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; o JXTA protocol implementations<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; o JXTA-aware application</p><u>Limits of Board's Authority</u>. For as long as
JXTA is not a free-standing, independent legal entity, the JXTA board
does not have authority to make decisions on items that have financial
or legal impact to Sun Microsystems without explicit, written approval
by Sun Microsystems. The Sun appointed board member will be entrusted
to ensure appropriate company officials provide the written
authorization. The board may make any recommendations regarding the
direction and operation of jxta.dev.java.net to Sun Microsystems via
the Sun appointed board member. The board may not vote out of office
the Sun appointed board member.<br />
<strong>JXTA Elected Board Member Term</strong>
<p><u>Election</u> A JXTA elected board member's term
is 2 years for a member elected during a normal election as defined by
the JXTA board election rules published on JXTA. The normal term period
for a board member begins the first of March and ends on the last day
of February. The board recommends that elections be conducted during
mid-January through mid-February such that the election results can be
certified and the new board members announced to the community by 15
February. </p><p>
<u>Removing a Board Member</u>. Any board member not
appointed by Sun Microsystems may be removed from office if his or her
conduct is deemed by a majority of board members to not be in the best
interest of the JXTA community. This includes, for example, members
that request to be removed, fail to respond to meeting invitations
within the appointed period, are repeatedly disruptive to JXTA
community and board activities, or engage in activities that present a
conflict of interest. A board member is removed if a majority of board
members at two consecutive board meetings vote to remove him or her.
The board may not vote out of office the Sun appointed board member.
However, the Board may petition the appropriate Sun Program Manager for
Project JXTA to replace the appointed board member.</p>
<p><u>Special Election</u>. A special election to
complete an existing term is called after the removal or other
termination of an elected board member. A board member elected during a
special election is elected for the duration of the term of the board
member being replaced. Any board member in good standing may be
re-nominated for re-election except for a person removed during his or
her term. Such ex-board members are permanently prohibited from running
or being elected to any future JXTA board seat.</p>
<p>
<strong>JXTA Sun-Appointed Board Member Term</strong></p>
<p>A JXTA Sun-appointed board member's term is 12 months by
default and it is recommended, but not required, that the period served
corresponds to the elected members' term period. The Sun-appointed
board member may be changed at any time and the existing member should
take responsibility to ensure a smooth transition. In the event the
Sun-appointed board member abdicates his or her responsibilities
without identifying his or her replacement, the elected board members
will contact the appropriate Sun Microsystems official sponsoring JXTA
Technology to request a new appointment as a first order of business.</p>
<p><strong>JXTA Board Meetings</strong></p>
<p><u>Definition</u>. A JXTA Board Meeting is an
official gathering by two or more board members (a quorum) where JXTA
business is conducted. Board members may attend a board meeting in
person, by phone, by video conference, or other means that enable the
member to participate in real-time with all other attendees. Instant
Messaging and email are not acceptable means of attendance in a board
meeting.</p>

<p><u>Frequency of Meetings</u>. Board meetings
should be held once per quarter or more frequently as issues warrant.
Board meetings may be called by any member of the Board. Board meetings
may also be requested by the JXTA Community Manager, the JXTA Program
Manager, or any JXTA Community Member. However, only meetings called by
a current board member are mandatory.</p>

<p><u>Scheduling of Meetings</u>. A Board meeting
must be scheduled within ten (10) business days of the date of request
by a board member. The JXTA Community Manager may be asked to assist in
scheduling an optimal meeting time.</p>

<p><u>Meeting Notifications</u>. All board members
must be invited to participate in any board meeting at least three (3)
business days prior to the meeting. Meeting invitations are deemed to
be valid if reasonable efforts were made to reach board members such as
by email with no error returned, phone call and message to the last
known good number for the board member, written Post mail sent to the
last known valid street or post office address for the member with no
return message, or other generally accepted invitation mechanism. A
board member may decline to participate in a board meeting and give
consent for others to meet without him or her in which case the meeting
will proceed as planned. Should a board member not acknowledge the
invitation within ten (10) business days of a reasonable invitation,
the board member requesting the meeting may proceed with the meeting at
the soonest date convenient for all responding members who intended to
attend.</p>

<p><u>Meeting Types, Participants, and their Roles</u>.
Meetings may be open or closed at the discretion of board members
calling the meeting. Closed meetings are limited to only board member
participation. Open meetings may include, in addition to board members,
one or more of JXTA community manager, JXTA program manager, or JXTA
community member. The degree to which a meeting is open is at the
discretion of the board members. When board members do not have
consensus on the appropriate attendance for a meeting, the meeting
becomes a closed meeting. Open meetings should be scheduled with
reasonable lead time, at the discretion of the board, to encourage
appropriate attendance.<br />
Maximizing transparency of board activities is strongly encouraged. It
is recommended, but not required, that an external observer, for
example, JXTA community manager, participate in all board meetings.
Each meeting should have an assigned meeting leader selected from
attending board members and a note taker selected from any meeting
participant. Non board members attending the meeting may be asked to
comment or contribute to the meeting.</p>

<p><u>Item Resolution (Board Voting)</u>. Only board
members attending a meeting can vote on items raised during the board
meeting. A simple majority is required for any items for which there is
no consensus. In the event that there is a tie in the voting on an
item, the issue will be deferred to the next board meeting to allow any
non-attending board members to vote on the item. A board member's vote
on an item is carried into the next board meeting even if the board
member does not attend the next meeting. A board member must attend the
next meeting in order to reverse his or her prior vote on record for an
item that remained in a tie. Should the item remain in a tie after two
consecutive board meetings, the Sun appointed board member will be
given an additional vote used to break the tie.</p>

<p><u>Meeting Conduct and Structure</u>. Meetings
should generally follow the standing agenda items:</p>
1. Designation of meeting leader selected from participating board<br />
members. Leader guides meeting through the agenda items that follow<br />
2. Call to order and roll call<br />
3. Assignment of meeting note taker for current meeting selected from<br />
any meeting participant (not necessarily a board member)<br />
4. Review of previous meeting minutes and approval with our without<br />
modification<br />
5. Status of existing open items from prior meetings.<br />
6. Identification of new topics and agreement of which ones to cover<br />
7. Discussion of selected new topics<br />
8. Identification and assignment of new action items<br />
9. Scheduling of next meeting<br />
10. Move to adjourn<br />
<u>Meeting Notes Publication</u>. Meeting minutes are not
to be published until after ratification at a subsequent Board Meeting.
Meeting notes are to be sent by the appointed note taker for review by
all board members within two (2) weeks of the board meeting. While
maximum transparency of board activities is encouraged (and hence
publishing all meeting notes on the jxta.dev.java.net community pages
is recommended), any attending board member may identify any items not
to be published due to their sensitive or personal nature. Such items
are not to be published unless overturned by majority vote during the
subsequent board meeting.<br />
<h2><a name="Election_Process"></a>Election
Process<br />
</h2>
<p>The JXTA Community actively participates in all aspects around
the development of JXTA technology. Although our Community is largely
self-governing, our Board of Directors serves to provide high-level
guidence as needed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This section provides information on the election process by
which the JXTA Community chooses new members for the Board.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Eligibility.</span>&nbsp;
All JXTA Technology community members in good standing may vote and are
also eligible to run for a Community Board Member position. A community
member must have a Kenai user id and have commit access on at least one
project.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Nominations.</span>&nbsp;
Nominations may be made by any Community Member by posting to the
mailing lists.&nbsp;Self-nominations are acceptable. All

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Election
Certification.</span>&nbsp; Elections of community board
members are certified by the JXTA Technology community manager or other
Board appointed JXTA community member charged with conducting the
election. No board members may be appointed any responsibilities for
conducting any JXTA election while he or she is serving on the JXTA
board. The vote will be considered valid if votes are received from at
